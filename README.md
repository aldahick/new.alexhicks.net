# new.alexhicks.net

A new version of my website. Has some utilities and cool stuff, mostly on the [back-end](https://github.com/aldahick/api.alexhicks.net).

## Building

You can set several environment variables to affect the build output:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| PUBLIC_URL | Standard React environment variable, protocol+host+port+path (`http://localhost:3000/new/`) |
| REACT_APP_BASE_URL | Affects `react-router`, path (`/new/`) |
| REACT_APP_API_URL | URL of API server for this front-end, protocol+host+port+path (`http://localhost:3001/api/`) |
